# Problem:
Write a function most_frequent_word(text) that:
Takes a string of text
Counts how many times each word appears
Returns the most frequent word and its frequency

Example
text = "apple banana apple mango mango mango banana"
Output → ("mango", 3)

# Solution:
text = "apple banana apple mango mango mango banana"
l = text.lower().split(" ")
l1 = {}
for i in l: 
  l1[i] = l.count(i)
most_word = max(l1, key = l1.get)
most_count = l1[most_word]
print(most_count, most_word)

alternate code

from collections import Counter
text = "apple banana apple mango mango mango banana"
counts = Counter(text.lower().split())
most_word, most_count = counts.most_common(1)[0]
print(most_word, most_count)


# problem 2
Filter Even Numbers & Compute Their Square
Task
Write a function square_evens(nums) that:
Takes a list of integers
Keeps only the even numbers
Returns a new list where each even number is squared

def square_evens(nums):
  num1 = []
  for i in nums:
    if i % 2 == 0:
       num1.append(i*i)
  return num1    

result  = square_evens([1,2,3,4,5,6])
print(result)
