# Problem 1
Write a function most_frequent_word(text) that:
Takes a string of text
Counts how many times each word appears
Returns the most frequent word and its frequency

Example
text = "apple banana apple mango mango mango banana"
Output → ("mango", 3)

# Solution:
text = "apple banana apple mango mango mango banana"
l = text.lower().split(" ")
l1 = {}
for i in l: 
  l1[i] = l.count(i)
most_word = max(l1, key = l1.get)
most_count = l1[most_word]
print(most_count, most_word)

alternate code

from collections import Counter
text = "apple banana apple mango mango mango banana"
counts = Counter(text.lower().split())
most_word, most_count = counts.most_common(1)[0]
print(most_word, most_count)


# problem 2
Filter Even Numbers & Compute Their Square
Task
Write a function square_evens(nums) that:
Takes a list of integers
Keeps only the even numbers
Returns a new list where each even number is squared

Solution
def square_evens(nums):
  num1 = []
  for i in nums:
    if i % 2 == 0:
       num1.append(i*i)
  return num1    

result  = square_evens([1,2,3,4,5,6])
print(result)

# Problem 3:
Reverse a String (without using slicing)

string = "Hello"
newl = []
for i in range(len(string), 0, -1):
  newl.append(string[i])

revstr = "".join(newl)
print(revstr)

# problem 4
Write a function divisible(nums) that returns a list of all numbers that are divisible by 3 or 5.

def divisible(nums):
  l = []
  for i in nums:
    if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
      l.append(i)
  return l

result = divisible([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
print(result)

# problem 5
Write a function is_sorted(lst) that checks if the list is sorted in ascending order.

def is_sorted(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True

# problem 6
Given a list of words, return a dictionary with each word and its length.

lst = ["cat", "elephant", "dog"]
d = {}
for i in lst:
  d[i] = len(i)
print(d)
